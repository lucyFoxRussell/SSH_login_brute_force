    "# SSH Brute-Force with Paramiko and Pwntools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I built a simple brute-force script to attempt SSH login using the `Paramiko` library in Python. The script tries a list of passwords (from `100k-most-used-passwords-NCSC.txt`) to find a valid credential for SSH login on a local machine. I also imported `Pwntools`, but it’s not heavily used here."

    "I told the client to automatically accept any unknown host keys using AutoAddPolicy. This is important because when you connect to an SSH server for the first time, you usually get a warning about the server's SSH key not being recognized.

    "## Lessons learned, reflections and conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "What I Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "Paramiko is a very straightforward library for interacting with SSH, making it easy to create simple brute-force scripts in Python for educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Relevance: This script is a good reminder of how attackers might use brute-force or dictionary attacks to gain unauthorized access to systems, especially if they can guess or find weak passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Measures: This project also highlighted the need for strong password policies, SSH key authentication, and defense mechanisms like lockout mechanisms and rate-limiting to prevent such attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Considerations:\n",
    "Even with just 10 attempts in this example, it’s clear that brute-forcing takes time, especially with large wordlists. If I were trying to crack SSH credentials for a real attack, it would likely require optimizations like parallel processing or distributed cracking to speed things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling and Clean-Up:\n",
    "I also realised how important it is to handle exceptions properly in repeated connection attempts, as failing to do so can lead to resource leaks or misleading error states. This is why I included client.close() in the finally block after each attempt to ensure the connection is properly cleaned up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "This project was a hands-on way to explore SSH brute-forcing and password cracking techniques, and it really reinforced the importance of secure authentication practices. It also gave me a deeper understanding of how attackers might try to gain access to systems and how to defend against such methods."
